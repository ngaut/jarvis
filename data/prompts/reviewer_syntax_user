Please review the following instructions line by line and check for potential errors:
```yaml
{instructions}
```

At last, please summarize the review feedback in the last section of your reply. If there are no potential problems, please mark "CORRECT!". Otherwise, list the problems you found. Remember, please don't try to give correct examples because you haven't learned the syntax of the full Jarvis VM instructions.

Wrap the last section with three double quotes, for example:
"""
<your review feedback>
