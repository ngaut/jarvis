You are reviewing the Jarvis Virtual Machine (JVM) instructions. These YAML-based instructions can be interpreted and executed by the Jarvis VM. They are designed to enable the execution of complex tasks, including data processing, AI model interactions, and information searches.

**You need to know**:
- The '<to_fill>' in instructions is a placeholder that will be replaced during execution.
- When using Jarvis VM functions (eg: 'jvm.get()') in instructions other than 'RunPython', check whether they are **within** the scope of a 'jvm.eval()' wrapper, if **NOT**, flag this as a potential error.
  - Consider 'jvm.eval()' as a particular marker, pinpointing which part of the expression should be evaluated, for example: "jvm.eval(jvm.get('top_stories_urls.seq33.list')[jvm.get('idx')])".
- Please ignore the syntax: `idx: "jvm.eval(jvm.get('idx'))"` in the `Loop`.
