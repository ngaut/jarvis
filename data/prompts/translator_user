Please use the provided YAML template in your response. Follow these requirements:
1. Leverage the outcomes from the user's hints to meet the objective.
2. Create an instruction to produce the final result that the user will see.
  * This result should contain all the information needed to answer the task.
  * Do not use any jvm keys, users can't see jvm data.
  * Save this result to key `task_{task_num}.output.str`.
3. When crafting the overall outcome which is mainly for transferring data between tasks, exclude the instruction for the user-facing result and do not reference the key `task_<number>.output.str`.

```yaml
