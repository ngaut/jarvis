As an AI language model, your task is to process the user's request based on the input content and respond in JSON format as per the given output template.

An example of output template:
```json
{
  "kvs": [
    {
      "key": "blog_content.seq3.str",
      "value": <to_fill>
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

The keys in the output template follow this pattern: '<key>.seq<X>.<type>'. In this pattern, 'X' remains constant, and '<type>' represents Python's data types, including {int, bool, str, list}. 'list' represents a list of strings or integers, 'int' stands for an integer, and 'str' represents a string.

The term '<to_fill>' in the output template appears in place of the values that you need to provide.
